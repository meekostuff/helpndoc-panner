HelpNDoc-Panner
===============

[HelpNDoc](http://www.helpndoc.com/) is a Help-Authoring-Tool 
which can generate documentation in a number of formats 
including HTML for the Web. 
Its default HTML generator uses HTML Framesets. 

[HyperFrameset](https://github.com/meekostuff/HyperFrameset) 
uses AJAX and `history.pushState` to revolutionize 
the concept of HTML Framesets. 
In particular, HyperFrameset pages synchronize the URL in the address-bar
with the URL of the primary content being viewed. 

**HelpNDoc-Panner** is a HelpNDoc template that generates 
HyperFrameset enabled documentation. 
The pages will look like the default HelpNDoc output 
but the framesets are emulated with AJAX 
and navigation is handled with `history.pushState`.


Installation
------------

Use the browser to navigate to the **HelpNDoc-Panner**
[github page](https://github.com/meekostuff/helpndoc-panner).

Click on the "Clone or download" button (near the top-right of the page).

Click on the "Download ZIP" link in the popup.

Unzip the downloaded file and rename the extracted directory to 
"HyperFrameset HTML Template".

Move this directory to your 
**HelpNDoc** customized HTML templates directory -
"My Documents\Templates\html\".

Read the [HelpNDoc manual](http://www.helpndoc.com/sites/default/files/documentation/html/index.html) for 
[Low-level template details](http://www.helpndoc.com/sites/default/files/documentation/html/Bestpractices.html).

From the "Home" ribbon tab in **HelpNDoc**, click the "Generate Help" button to show the generation window. From this window you can specify that HTML documentation builds should use "HyperFrameset HTML Template". 

Read [Publishing Documentation](http://www.helpndoc.com/sites/default/files/documentation/html/Publishingdocumentation.html) for details.


Borwser Support
---------------

The documentation generated by this template works fine in all browsers -
old or new, javascript enabled or not.

HyperFrameset requires features provided by modern mainstream browsers - 
in general this means IE10+ - 
so in older browsers (or with Javascript disabled) 
you won't get the frameset view.

Testing Locally
---------------

All modern browsers have significant restrictions on using AJAX with the local file-system - that is, when using the `file:` protocol. Because HyperFrameset depends on AJAX, these restrictions could prevent HyperFrameset from implementing the frameset view of your pages.

If you want to view your generated documentation on your local machine it is recommended to run a minimal HTTP server. The following are only suggestions.

- [Mongoose](https://www.cesanta.com/products/binary)
- [Fenix](http://fenixwebserver.com/)

If you don't want to install a HTTP server then either use Firefox, or
call Chrome with the `allow-file-access-from-files` option:

1. Click the Windows `Start` button
2. Type the following into the Start Search Box
	
	```
	chrome.exe --allow-file-access-from-files
	```
